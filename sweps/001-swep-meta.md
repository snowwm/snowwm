## Abstract

SWEP stands for **snowwm's World Enhancement Proposal**. This concept is inspired by [PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)](https://python.org/dev/peps). It came to life as a consequence of the fact that neatly and pedantically organazing information is among the things I like to do most in this life. I also like [superficially] impressive-looking things.

## SWEP headers

### ID

Contains the SWEP number and a short name (hyphenated all-lowercase phrase).

### Type

One of `Proposal`, `Notes`, and `Rant`. Use of `Rant` is discouraged :wink:.

### Category

Describes the kind of things to be enhanced :smiley:.

### Status

For `Proposal` SWEPs the status flow is `Draft` -> `Pending` -> `WIP` -> `Complete`.

For `Notes` and `Rant` SWEPs the status flow is `Draft` -> `Active`.

Additionally, any SWEP can become `Abandoned` or `Obsolete`.
